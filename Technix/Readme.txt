ABOUT THE SOFTWARE

Title : Techni-X Filter (Fotomatic Series)
Version : 1.3
Date : January 2005

A single plug-in for use with Photoshop-compatible host applications. It produces a very high contrast effect in order to turn your colour photographs into clear B&W images suitable for cheap reproduction via printing methods that have a limited tonal capacity, such as newsprint or the office photocopier for example. Although this filter was originally designed for this specific "technical" purpose, you can use it to simply give your images a dramatic stylized look. You can also add a high-impact colour-cast with the built-in RGB settings.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (PC)

Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP
Photoshop-compatible host application

* Please note that not all graphics programs are 100% compatible with plug-in filters. Some will display the controls a bit differently or certain features may not work properly. Consult your program's documentation for more information regarding the use of 3rd-party plug-ins.

This filter was programmed specifically for Adobe Photoshop but it should work fine with many other hosts too. If you encounter any compatibility problems then please report the details and I will do my very best to fix any errors that occur, if possible.
