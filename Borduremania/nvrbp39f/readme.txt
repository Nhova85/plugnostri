BorderMania and BorderMania Pro

Copyright (c) 1997-2003 New Virtual Research, all rights reserved

NVR BorderMania Pro is a set of plugin filters for Adobe Photoshop
and other graphics programs including JASC Paint Shop Pro and Corel
Photo-Paint. NVR BorderMania Pro is distributed free of charge for a 30
day evaluation period, after which some of the features require a
license fee for continued use. The Pro features include support for
multiple color modes, advanced image preview, control setting history
list and anti-aliasing. The remaining features are identical to the
original BorderMania 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 features, and like those earlier
versions may be used free of charge indefinitely. A license can be
purchased through the NVR web site named below. See the accompanying
license agreement file LICENSE.DOC or LICENSE.TXT for specific rights
and privileges.

To install, simply copy all of the files with .8bf extensions to the
Photoshop or other graphics program plugin directory. This will
typically be C:\PHOTOSHP\PLUGINS or a similar directory name. The next
time you start Photoshop the filters will automatically appear in the
Filter dropdown menu as the NVR BorderMania group. If you are already
running Photoshop, exit the program and restart it for the filters to
become active. For more specific installation instructions for Photoshop
or other graphics programs go to the NVR web site named below.
