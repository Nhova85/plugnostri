------------- AFH Beveler Plugins ------------------
This zip file contains two versions of the freeware
AFH Beveler plugin for Windows Adobe Photoshop 3.0+.

Version 2.0a offers more control over the shading
of the bevels than 1.0, but treats corner butts
slightly differently, so both versions are included
here.

To use the plugins, copy the *.8bf files into your
Photoshop plugins directory.

These plugins were generated with the Adobe Photoshop
Filter Factory.  The source files (*.afs) are
included to allow you to regenerate the plugins on
platforms other than Windows.

Please send comments/suggestions to alex@afh.com.

Enjoy!

Updated 4:20 AM 11/7/97:

- Added AFH Beveler 2.0c for use with non-Adobe host
  programs (does not require the plugin.dll file).

------------- AFH Beveler Plugins ------------------
This zip file contains four versions of the freeware
AFH Beveler plugin for Windows Adobe Photoshop 3.0+.

=> To use the plugins, copy the *.8bf files into your
=> Photoshop plugins directory (or the equivalent
=> directory for other Adobe-compatible host programs
=> such as Paint Shop Pro 4).

Version 2.0a offers more control over the shading
of the bevels than 1.0, but treats corner butts
slightly differently, so both versions are included
here.

Version 2.0b differs from 2.0a only in the manner the
preview window is scaled.  In 2.0b, the size of the
bevel in the preview window is scaled in direct
proportion to the scaling of the preview, thus
giving a more accurate preview of the final full-scale
result.

Version 2.0c is functionally identical to 2.0b, but
was created in the older 56KB Filter Factory format,
which does *not* require the use of the Adobe-proprietary
dynamic link library file "plugin.dll" (see below).
Thus, version 2.0c (afhbev2c.8bf) is useable with
many non-Adobe image processing programs which did
*not* work with earlier versions of the Beveler
filters.  (Note that version 2.0c still requires
the "msvcrt10.dll" dynamic link library, which is
supplied in this zip file.)

These plugins were generated with the Adobe Photoshop
Filter Factory.  The source files (*.afs) are
included to allow you to regenerate the plugins on
platforms other than Windows.  (The Adobe Photoshop
Filter Factory is included on the Photoshop 3.0 and
4.0 installation CD-ROMs, but must be installed
manually.  You do *not* need to install the Filter 
Factory itself in order to use plugins generated
by the Filter Factory; install Filter Factory on
your system only if you are interested in generating
or converting your own plugin filters.)

=================== UPDATE FOR PHOTOSHOP 4.0 ======================

The AFH Beveler plugin filters require two files normally installed
by Photoshop 3.04.  The required files are PLUGIN.DLL (normally 
installed in your c:\photoshp directory) and MSVCRT10.DLL (normally
installed in your c:\windows\system directory).

If you are missing either of these two files, then the AFH Beveler
filters will not show up in the plugin menu of your application.

Apparently Photoshop 4.0 no longer installs MSVCRT10.DLL (though
I think it still installs PLUGIN.DLL).

I've included a copy of msvcrt10.dll in the zip file in case
you need it:

msvcrt10.dll -- If this file is not already installed on your
                system, place a copy of it in your 
                \windows\system directory (or whatever it's 
                called on your system).

The plugin.dll file is installed by several Adobe products,
including Adobe Photoshop:

plugin.dll   -- If this file is not already installed on your
                system, place a copy of it in your 
                \windows\system directory (or whatever it's 
                called on your system).

Once these files are in the correct directory, open an image
in RGB mode in Photoshop.  Then, under the Filter menu you
should see "AFH".  Under AFH, you should see all the AFH
Beveler filters you have installed (e.g., AFH Beveler 1.0,
AFH Beveler 2.0a, etc.).  Choose one of those filters and
have fun!

If you still have problems getting the beveler plugin to work,
send me e-mail at alex@afh.com ...

Good luck!
