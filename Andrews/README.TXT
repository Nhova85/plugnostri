These filters are for free. For discussion and
all that sort of thing. No Warranty given.
These are given on the understanding that
they are used at the user's own risk. 
No payment required. These filters have been created
just for the joy of creating and understanding the tools better
and for applying to my own pictures.

The filters, 200+, have been created over a period
of time. Some work with colour and not B&W and
vica versa. Some work with pics with more background
than foreground, some work with the main feature being in 
the centre of the pic and others with the main feature at the
edge. There might be some duplication of filters or at least
similar effects might be possible with a number of filters.

They have been designed to work with PhotoShop 3 and
probably 4 and possibly 
other apps on a Window Platform. The afs files have not been
included because in some cases they just don't exist - a 
tool exists to get the source from the 8bf - see the web pages
about this utility. The number of filters may cause memory problems
so possibly load only some of them and keep the rest in 
other plugin directories.
