ABOUT THE SOFTWARE

Title : ColourWorks Filter (Works Series)
Version : 3.1
Date : January 2005

A single Photoshop-compatible plug-in containing 20 effects for modifying image colour values in various ways. You can use them for subtle correction of your digital photos and CG graphics, or experiment with the more dramatic transformations that are available. Although quite basic these filters can be handy for use on a regular basis.

HISTORY

The "Works" series of plug-ins were first developed back in 1998 and have been updated and re-compiled several times over the years. Versions 1 & 2 of ColourWorks contained 20 individual plug-in filters, but this latest update has incorportated all the main effects into one single filter dialog with a drop-down menu for ease of use.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (PC)

Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP
Photoshop-compatible host application

* Please note that not all graphics programs are 100% compatible with plug-in filters. Some will display the controls a bit differently or certain features may not work properly. Consult your program's documentation for more information regarding the use of 3rd-party plug-ins.

This filter was programmed specifically for Adobe Photoshop but it should work fine with many other hosts too. If you encounter any compatibility problems then please report the details and I will do my very best to fix any errors that occur, if possible.

INSTALLATION

1. Please remove any previous version of ColourWorks before installing Version 3.1

    for example ... C:\Photoshop\Plug-Ins\Cybia

    (not all software will require this step, please refer to the instructions given with your host)

4. Exit your program and re-start in order for your configuration settings to take effect

5. Open an image ready to edit, making sure it is in RGB mode
