
DragonFly´s Retrodots Filter
-----------------------------

William Christenson gave me the idea for this filter.
I really like this nice little filter.
If you have any ideas for new filters please let me know.

This filter is free, but if you want to redistribute it in any form
please contact me.

If you have some nice work done with it i´d be really interested
to see it. Please mail me and tell me about.
I.E. Jamie Flint did a very nice postcard with my previous sinedots
filter and mailed me some of those. Such stuff really makes my day :)

Requirements:
-------------
- Win32
- photoshop compatible host program

Installing:
-----------
Just copy the file 'Retrodots.8bf' somewhere into the
plugin directory of the program you want to use the filter with.


Usage:
------
Use the filter with a smooth selection. Otherwise it will look horrible.
The selections strength determines the size of the dots.

Parameters names should be self explaining.
