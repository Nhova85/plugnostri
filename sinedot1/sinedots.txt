
DragonFly압 Sinedot Shader
--------------------------

This is my first try in creating a photoshop Filter.
I choose this old demoeffect because it압 nice and easy to implement.
I know that it is slow, extremly unintuitiv and probably not very usefull.
Hopefully somebody has a use for it anyway.

It should work with any photoshop 3.0+ compatible host under Windows 95/98/NT.

This filter is free, but if you actually use it for some work i앇 really
like to see the result. So it앇 be kind to mail me the url if available.
Interesting settings are appreciated, too.

You may redistribute this filter as long as you do two things:
1st: Mail me at 'DragonPhil@gmx.de' and tell me.
2nd: Distribute the unmodified files only together as one including this text file.

Btw. I enabled all kinds of modes just because it압 possible.
Please consider that i do no color conversion and thus the effect will
have different colors for different modes...

Mail me for any comment, suggestion, bug report, etc.
If you have ideas for new Plug-Ins.... i앐 interested, too.

Parameters:
----------

The filter produces a curve which continually changes and shades itself into the picture.
Because of the nature of the effect it압 a bit difficult to explain the
parameters affection on the result. I앏l give it a try anyway:

1st Dimension압
X-1/X-2
Y-1/Y-2:   These Parameters determine the appeareance of the starting curve.
           Values are represented as angles given in multiples of Pi.
           
2nd Dimension압
X-1/X-2
Y-1/Y-2:   These Parameters determine how the starting curve developes and moves.

Density:   Determines the amount of Dots beeing used for the effect
           and thus the brightness/darkness the reulting structure.

Inverse:   Inverts the 'shading direction'. Means the color values are
           either increased or decreased.

BalanceX
BalanceY:  Defines the influence of X-1/Y-1 values relativ to X-2/Y-2


Settings:
--------

It압 possible to save settings to disc. The entry '_defaults'
is used to save the most recently applied values.
Means: Every time you press the OK-Button the current settings
are saved under this name.
You can find the settings in the "sinedots.cfg" file which should
normally be located in the same folder as this Plug-in.




Installing:
----------
Short version: Execute the 'installer.exe' type in the desired folder under
your standard Plug-In folder and push ok.

Long Version: If the installer is not able to locate this directoy for
you (probably this will work for Photoshop 5.0+ only) and youre to lazy
to type in the whole path. Or the installer does not work for some other
reason, you may also copy the needed files by hand into your Plug-In압 folder.
Needed files are:
'AssignPath.exe',
'sinedots.8bf' and
'sinedots.cfg'

Then you앏l have to run AssignPath.exe out of that directoy!

The AssignPath does nothing else but to create a registry entry for my plug-in
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\DragonFly\Sinedot Shader\Path)
so it can find it압 config file in the current path.

If you should move the plug-in to a different folder someday please don앖 forget
to run the AssignPath.exe again or use the installer, so the plug-in will find
it압 config file.




And for those who are interested in how the effect works,
it압 basically something like this:


    innerCount = (width+height)*gDensity*5;
    outerCount = (width+height)*gDensity*5;

    angle1 = pi * X1 / innerCount;
    angle2 = pi * X2 / innerCount;
    angle3 = pi * Y1 / innerCount;
    angle4 = pi * Y2 / innerCount;

    angle5 = pi * X11;
    angle6 = pi * X22;
    angle7 = pi * Y11;
    angle8 = pi * Y22;

    for (int j = 0;j < outerCount;j++)
    {
        double SinIndexX1 = ((angle5/outerCount) * j;
        double SinIndexX2 = ((angle6/outerCount) * j;
        double SinIndexY1 = ((angle7/outerCount) * j;
        double SinIndexY2 = ((angle8/outerCount) * j;
        
        for (int i = innerCount;i > 0;--i)
        {
            SinIndexX1 += angle1;
            SinIndexX2 += angle2;
            SinIndexY1 += angle3;
            SinIndexY2 += angle4;

            int x = width/2;
            x += (width/2-1) * ((gBalanceX * sin(SinIndexX1)) + ((1-gBalanceX) * sin(SinIndexX2)));

            int y = height/2;
            y += (height/2-1) * ((gBalanceY * cos(SinIndexY1)) + ((1-gBalanceY) * cos(SinIndexY)));

            Shade(x,y,Inverse);
            }
    }
