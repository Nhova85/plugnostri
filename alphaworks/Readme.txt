ABOUT THE SOFTWARE

Title : AlphaWorks Filter
Version : 3.0
Date : January 2004

A single Photoshop-compatible plug-in filter for quickly removing black or white values and making the region transparent. There are 6 different options for you to choose from, depending on the type of image you are working on (colour photo, mono photo, lineart). It requires the use of "Layers" so remember the effect must be applied to an image that is on a layer above the background in order for it to work.

WHAT'S NEW?

Versions 1 & 2 of AlphaWorks contained 20 individual plug-in filters, but this latest update has incorportated all the main effects into one single filter dialog with a drop-down menu for ease of use. Although there are less filters this time, you can still perform all the same effects as with previous versions.
