In order to use these FFL files, they have been created using the Plugin Commander, which can also be used to compile them into usable 8bf files for use in other programs which support Photoshop plugins.  Follow my links on the page at: <http://www.netins.net/showcase/wolf359/plugins.htm> for Plugin Commander to obtain a copy.  This is a PC based program, and does not need Photoshop to run as it is a stand alone program.
