Adobe Photoshop compartible filters package "Toadies"

1. Brief description of the package.

The package contains a set of plug-in filters for Adobe Photoshop 3.0 (or
higher).
Filters are available in two modifications for Windows and Mac respectively.

Filters also were tested by author and shown to work with the following host
applications:
(Win) Fractal Design Painter 4.0 (32-bit) or higher;
(Win) JASC Paint Shop Pro 4.0 or higher;(Win) Ulead GIF Animator 3.0;
(Win) GIMP 1.1.0 (Win32 port);
(Win) IrfanView 2.97 and higher (freeware viewing/converting utility).

According to users feedback, they also work with the following host
applications:
(Win) Corel Photo Paint 7.0 and above;
(Win, Mac) Adobe Illustrator 7.0;
(Win) SPG ColorWorks 3;
(Win) Ulead PhotoImpact 3 and above;
(Unix) GIMP 1.1.0 by using User Filter plugin.

All filters were created using Adobe Photoshop Filter Factory (FF).

Current location of the package under http://www.chat.ru/~bufo/

Note for Mac users: all these filters originated as Windows version. Due to
Win/Mac FF difference, many filters are recompiled for Mac in "light" form only,
without some features/controls originally presented in Win versions; some
filters cannot be recompiled with current Mac FF so they are available for
Windows only. Filter decriptions are based on Windows version and do not always
match Mac filters.

Notes for a non-Photoshop users on Windows side: first, Transparency Effects do
not work properly under plug-in friendly applications having alpha channel
structure different from Photoshop. Please read the respective plug-in filters
description; second, all these plug-in filters require MSVCRT10.DLL to run.
Photoshop installs this file into user's system but other hosts sometimes do
not. If properly installed filters do not show in filters menu - check out
whether you have MSVCRT10.DLL in your system before sending complains to the
author.

3. Filters Description

Blast 'em!
Applies diffuse effect. Both effect amount and transparency are controllable.

Blur 'em!
A complex diffuse effect more pronounced at the contrast image edges.

*Sucking Toad*  Bevel I
Rectangular buttonmaker.

*Sucking Toad*  Bevel II
Rectangular buttonmaker. Both button shape and shading algorithm are different
from No. I.

*Sucking Toad*  Bevel III
Round buttonmaker - turns an image into cone shaded button over "black
transparent" background.

*Sucking Toad*  Bevel IV
Oval buttonmaker - turns an image into oval button over "black
transparent" background.

Metalwork.
Generates many extra hughlights/shadows, thus making image look shiny and
metallic, by applying two sine transfer functions.

Crazy Colour Waves
A "false-colour" version of "Metalwork".

Metallic Onion.
Generates many extra hughlights/shadows, thus making image look shiny and
metallic, by applying sawtooth transfer function.

3D Mesh
Generates a checkerboard/grid pattern with a size proportional to the    
brightness of the original image, thus giving it a look as if it were   
mapped over a 3D object.

3D Supercheckers
Generate a complex fractal pattern with a size proportional to original image
brightness thus giving it a look of mapped over 3D object.

Cyborg
A combination of 3D Checkers and Metalwork, applies a 3D-looking grid pattern
over shiny metallized image.

Living Sine Linear
Produces a bright linear rainbow gradient displaced according to source image
brightness. Built-in source posterization provides additional "layered" effect.
Gradient is seamless i.e. left and right edges match perfectly.

Living Sine Circular
Produces a bright circular rainbow gradient rotated  according to source image
brightness. Built-in source posterization provides "layered" effect, like in
previous one.

Metalfalls
Generates multiple linear gradient bands with a frequency proportional to source
image brightness.

Boost
Promotes any grayshade to white, retaining a colour cast.

Banding Suppress Noise
Generates a hue-protected noise signal and subtracts it from original image, the
brighter the original is, the more noise applied. Good for eliminating banding
in
bright areas of inkjet prints and the like.

Old Photo
Provides subtle colour cast effect.

Plain Mosaic
Produces a range of mosaic effect, with rectangular (or oval over transparent
background) mosaic cells and various cell edge shadings.

Plain Mosaic Blur
Produce a mosaic of cells filled with a smooth blend between top left and bottom
right cell corners.

Ommadawn
Produce a mosaic of cells filled with a smooth blend between all four cell
corners.

Weaver
Produce a mosaic of cells filled with a cross-shaped smudges.

Picasso's Last Word
Produce a mosaic consisting of rectangular cells with size depending on source
image brightness. Depending on source image and user settings, results may vary
from artistic to ugly.

Picasso's Another Word
Yet another mosaic mosaic consisting of rectangular cells with size depending on
source image brightness, each cell have a gradient shading.

Bitches Crystal
Complex mosaic-distortion effect somewhat resembling facetted glass lens.

Rasterline
Turns an image into a horizonatal or vertical lines, either black on white or
original over transparent, with a line width proportional to source image
brightness.

Look, Butthead, a TV!
Turns image into a shaded/transparent horizontal lines producing a TV-screen
look.

Poster
Applies a brightness-only posterize effect, quite different from standard which
posterizes chroma also.

What Are You?
Makes image look dizzy - what else can I tell?

Inside-Out
User-controllable vortex effect. Note, on second run on the same settings,
restore image back (except for interpolation artifacts). Also note, this filter
belongs to "Distort" category.

The Toad's Pool I
Ripple-distortion effect. Please notice, this filter belongs to "Distort"
category.


The Toad's Pool II
Ripple-distortion effect. Please notice, this filter belongs to "Distort"
category.

Direct Opacity (TM):
Simply sets opacity value for a non-background layer. Not a big deal, but needed
often.

Glasswork Gray
Linear transparency effect: the darker the source image, the more   
opaque the result. White turns into "fully transparent black", black   
into "fully opaque black". Converts any image to grayscale   
(apparently).

Glasswork Colour
Linear transparency effect: the darker the source image, the more   
opaque the result. Works like "Glasswork Gray" but retains chroma.

3. Legal stuff

All these filters were created by Ilya Razmanov aka Ilyich the Toad; several
filters utilizes the ideas and/or code fragments created by some other people,
that is emphasized in "About" of every such a filter. All filters are freely
distributable; you may use, distribute for free (after receiving authors
permission), delete, reverse-engineer (for educational purposes only), giving a
credit to the author. You cannot pretend you developed these or your company
have
paid for the development; any commercial use without author's permission is
prohibited (in a word: don't try to make money on my freeware. Both images you
created and knowledge you earned is yours of course). You can make the entire
package only available for public download but you are obliged to ask author's
permission first; also, if you recompiled any particular filter for Premiere or
GIMP, you can distribute it separately, on a non-commercial basis only, giving a
credit to author and asking his permission. The complete source code of most
filters has been posted to the Filter Factory Discussion Group and is freely
available.
While distributing the entire pack or any particular filter, you are obliged to
keep this readme file with the filters.


4. Acknowledgments, apologies etc.

Many thanks to all active FFDG members for sharing their ideas;
Thanks to Helmut Schug and Tatsuya Sasaki for making Mac part available;
And apologies to all the companies whose ™'s, ©'s and ®'s were misspelled at
this
pages.

5. Contacting the author.

If you have any questions regarding Filter Factory programming, I strongly
recommend you, first of all, to visit the FFDG-related page under
http://pluginhead.i-us.com. There you will find either answers to all you
questions
or links to FAQs etc containing the answer. If you're still interested in
contacting
the author or feel that it's really necessary after that, you may always e-mail
him (means me) at ilyich@cacr.ioc.ac.ru. If you feel like contacting the author
on his particular filter matter, again, you're welcome to e-mail me.

Good luck and happy photoshopping!

----------------------------------------------------------
Special notes to bulk distributions of filters for Windows:

Bulk distributions are assembled in several forms:

1) as two large ZIP archives; simply unzip it into your Photoshop plugin dir.
Note that while the most filters go to separate "Toadies" category,
one ("Turn Your Inside Outside") goes to "Distort". One archive
contains filters for PS 3.0 (and higher) and PSP 5.0. These filters do
transparency tricks and won't work correctly under many host apps
pointed above. Another (larger) archive contains non-transparency
related filters which are shown to work correctly under all aps
forementioned.

2) as a self-extracting RAR archive, taking advantages of RAR solid
archives. Since RAR is not convenient on the net, I had to make archive
self-extracting involving disadvantage of large RAR exec header and
possible danger of viruses (although I did my best to check the exe
file with antiviruses). To install, simply run EXE file and browse to
the dir you want filters to be installed, then prompted. Take note,
transparency-related filters would be installed under special subdir
below dir you pointed; if you're working with PS 3.0-3.05, you should
move them to plugin dir above; with PS 4.0 and PSP 5.0 you should have
no problems at all; with all other forementioned hosts - simply delete
this unnecessary dir since you won't be able to use these filters;

3) as an archived .ffl file to be converted with Plugin Commander
(PiCo) available at http://pico.i-us.com. This distribution for is
very compact and is highly recommended to PiCo owners.

Take note, filters have a Win95 longnames and I recommend you
to keep it - file names correspond to filter name that simplifies
filters management.
